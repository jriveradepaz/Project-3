    <p class="caption"> Sopes are my favorite food they are made out of maize dough which is deepfried to make the round thing at the bottom, on top of that goes a layer of refried beans followed by either Carne asada or chorizo typically. Then they are topped by cheese, lettuce or cabbage, and sour cream. In some cases sauce also goes with them and same with diced up tomatoes. </p>
  <h2> Mole </h2>

    <p class="caption"> Mole is not a top choice of mine because of my poor spice tolerance but if you have a spice tolerance then it is good. It is supposed to be a mix of chocolate and peppers as well as other ingredients. It has a long list of ingredients. It is a traditional dish that is prepared different in different areas of Mexico.If you want a tutorial to cook Mole here is a link: https://www.houstoniamag.com/eat-and-drink/2013/06/30-minute-mole-june-2013 </p>
  <h2> Tacos </h2>
    <img src="images/tacos.jpg" alt="Picture of tacos" class="food">
    <p class="caption"> Tacos are probably the most known and popular Mexican food. The meat can vary from asada to al pastor to chorizo to even lengua which is the tongue of a cow. It can be eaten in a variety of ways with a variety of toppings such as cheese, cilantro, onion, salsa, guacamole etc. Since Mexicans use tortillas to eat you can basically make a taco out of anything you'd like the potential of tacos are unlimited. Making them of my favorite foods in the mexican culture.</p>
